Course Files for ED 795 Text Mining in Education 

### Syllabus


**Course Overview:** As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, an unprecedented amount of new data is becoming available to educational researchers and practitioners. Among these new data sources, unstructured data such as text represents a significant share. This introductory course to text mining is designed to prepare researchers and practitioners to use this data more efficiently, effectively, and ethically. This course will provide students with an overview of text mining as an analytical approach, examples of its use in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared help educational organizations understand and improve both online and blended learning environments.


**Number of Credits:** 3


**Course Prerequisites/Co-requisites:** This course requires doctoral-level standing. 


**Meeting Time:** This distance education course is predominantly asynchronous. Online tools are utilized throughout the course for communication and interaction. In addition, we may use Zoom for real-time web conferencing, virtual office hours, or whole class discussions.

**Required Course Texts:**

1. *Text Mining with R* is available free online (https://www.tidytextmining.com) or in paperback at O’Reilly and Amazon. 
2. *R for Data Science* is available free online (https://r4ds.had.co.nz) or in paperback at O’Reilly and Amazon. 

**Required and Recommended Software:** Students must have Internet access and access to a Web browser (e.g., Safari, Firefox, chrome) to participate in this course. The Moodle course site and Web-based software required for completing course projects may only be accessed online. It is strongly recommended that students have high-speed Internet access (e.g., cable modem). Finally, this course requires R and R Studio (linked below) that will be used to provide hands-on experience with the concepts and skills addressed in course readings. While tutorials will be provided for application of these tools, only basic instructions will be provided for their installation and troubleshooting. Students should feel comfortable installing new software programs and navigating unfamiliar graphical user interfaces. It is also recommended that students in this class have some background knowledge of online learning environments (e.g. LMS, MOOCs, etc.) and a understanding of basic descriptive statistics (e.g. distribution, mean, variability, etc.). 

Required: 

1. **R** (https://www.r-project.org) is an open-source language and computing environment for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Installation files for Windows, Mac, and Linux can be found at the website for the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), http://cran.r-project.org/. 
2. **R Studio** (https://www.rstudio.com) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R which includes an R console, syntax-highlighting editor, and tools for plotting, packages, and workspace management. The R Student Desktop application can be downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop. 

Optional:

3. **Git** is a free and open source distributed version control system. Jenny Bryan’s very thorough installation and R Studio set up process for Mac and Windows can be found here: http://happygitwithr.com. 
4. **GitHub** is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. You can create an account here: https://github.com 

**Server Space:** NC State is a Google Apps for Education institution. Your Google Drive provides "an infinitely large, ultra-secure, and entirely free bookbag for the 21st century."  This space may be useful for your project work, or you may use a third-party Internet service provider to place your data files and projects online (e.g., Github, Dropbox). In addition, Moodle provides space for storing private files. 

**Course Outcomes:** The primary goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper understanding of text mining as an analytical approach, as well and the applications of text mining in educational contexts. By the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:

1.	Define text mining and describe associated analytics techniques and data sources;
2.	Identify educational problems/questions/issues text mining has been used to understand or address;
3.	Prepare text-based data for analysis using tidy data principles;
4.	Apply text mining analytical techniques including visualization, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling;
5.	Recognize the ethical issues and limitations of using text mining approaches in education.

**Course Structure & Schedule:** This course is divided into 4 four-week units focused on common techniques in the field of learning analytics. Each unit consist of two sections. Section 1 of each unit introduces basic terminology, core concepts, and applications of an analytical approach through readings and course videos. In Section 2 of each unit, students develop skills in explore are provided a video walk-through of the software features using educational data as an example will design and implement an investigation that addresses the main components of the data analytics cycle. 

Unit 1: An Introduction to Learning Analytics and Data Dashboards (Weeks 2-5; Jan 16-Feb 12)
•	Introductions, syllabus review, and completed Learner Agreement.  
•	Students are introduced to the field of Learning Analytics, including general approaches and applications, with an initial focus on visualization of learner data.
•	Students develop basic skills with Tableau, a tool for data access and visualization, and create a data product that addresses a question of interest. 

Unit 2: Learner Interaction and Social Network Analysis (Weeks 5-8; Feb 6-Mar 19) 
•	Students are introduced to concepts and measures of SNA and the relationship between network measures and student learning.
•	Students develop basic skills with NodeXL, a tool for network analyses and visualization, and create a data product that addresses an learner question of interest.

Major Assignments/Projects: A major component of this course is active and productive participation in the course learning community through substantive contributions and constructive peer feedback. Students will complete four small data analysis projects, or data products, corresponding with the four major units that comprise the course. Students are permitted to work in small teams on data products, with size of team varying depending on depth of proposed product. Cumulative grades can be tracked during the semester by clicking the "Grades" link on the Moodle menu. All course assignments are submitted online.

Assessment: Community engagement and unit data products will be graded using criteria provided in the corresponding rubric. Full credit is not awarded for late work; however, assignments submitted by the due date may be revised and resubmitted for a higher grade by the following week.

Grading Scale: The grading scale is based on 100 points:
A+ (97-100), A (94-96), A- (90-93), B+ (87-89), B (84-86), B- (80-83)
